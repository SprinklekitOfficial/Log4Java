## Introduction 
* Log4Java is a Minecraft: Java Edition launcher for Android based on [MojoLauncher](https://github.com/MojoLauncher/MojoLauncher)
* This launcher can launch all available Minecraft versions ranging from rd-132211 to 26.x snapshots (including Combat Test versions). 
* Modding via Forge and Fabric are also supported. 

## Getting Log4Java

You can get Log4Java via four methods:

1. You can get the prebuilt app from the [releases section](http://github.com/GhostFoxOfficial/Log4Java/releases).

2. You can get early builds from [Github Actions](http://github.com/GhostFoxOfficial/Log4Java/actions).

4. You can [build](#building) from source.
## Building   
* Build the launcher (it will automatically download all required components)
```
./gradlew :app_pojavlauncher:assembleDebug
```
(Replace `./gradlew` with `.\gradlew.bat` if you are building on Windows).

## Current roadmap
- [x] Instance system in favor of profiles
- [x] Out-of-the box 1.21.5 support
- [x] mrpack/CurseForge zip import
- [x] LTW: resolve issues with Create
- [x] LTW: enable compute shader/image extensions

## Known Issues
- Some physical mice may have very slow mouse speed
- On Holy GL4ES, large texture atlases may be distorted (resulting in stretched/blocky textures in modpacks)
- Probably more, that's why we have a bug tracker ;)

- ## Now KivyAI is implemented!
Now launcher has an AI that soon will get full access to launcher (change settings, and more).
Check [KivyAI](https://github.com/GhostFoxOfficial/KivyAI) and README.txt for more info on setting up, etc. (You can build your own AI for your launcher if you forked).

## Building your own AI agent
1. You can edit, rewrite, or anything you want with the bridge (even add new bridge).
2. Edit web_app.py (the AI itself in launcher (KivyAI Agent, the name of AI in launcher), change it to your desire, you can rewrite if you wanna build from scratch).
3. Setup everything by clicking on KivyAI on upper message. (And check README.txt).
4. You're all set!
